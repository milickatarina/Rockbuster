# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

This project was part of my data analysis course at CareerFoundry to demonstrate necessary skills using the SQL programming language to  perform various kinds of query-based analyses, presenting the results  and findings using a visual analytic platform Tableau, and creating the  final presentation in PowerPointThe Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions to be answered by data analysis.

My role as a data analyst was to answer questions required by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries.

## About Rockbuster company:

• Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world.

• The biggest competitors: Netflix and Amazon Prime

• Company’s goal: use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service with the intention of staying competitive. 

## Projects key questions and objectives:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain? 

● What was the average rental duration for all videos? 

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? 

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based? 

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Basics

• Context: To answer the questions posed by the different departments, I 
queried the data using SQL (short for structured query language). 

• Data Set: I used a data set that contains information about Rockbuster’s
film inventory, customers, and payments, etc.

• Project Deliverables: At the end of each Exercise, I completed a task and 
submitted a deliverable that directly contributed to the final project—in 
this case, an analysis that answers business questions put forward by the 
management team.
