Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project - The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions to be answered by data analysis.

Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
